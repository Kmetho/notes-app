📝 Notes App
A clean, minimal note-taking app built to keep thoughts where they belong.
Built with modern tools, a bit of curiosity, and zero tolerance for outdated dependencies.

⭐ Overview
This project was created to explore Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS together for the first time — because growth > comfort.
Notes are fully interactive and draggable, giving you a lightweight desktop-style workspace directly in your browser.
Best experienced on desktop (where dragging things around just feels right).

🚀 Tech Stack
♥ Next.js – app structure & routing
♥ TypeScript – type safety and fewer “why is this undefined” moments
♥ Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling (first time using it, now slightly addicted)
♥ @dnd-kit – smooth drag-and-drop functionality
♥ Local Storage – persistent notes without a backend
♥ Vercel – deployment

All dependencies are up to date.

🎯 Features
♥ Create, edit, and delete notes
♥ Drag and reposition notes freely
♥ Persistent storage via browser localStorage
♥ Responsive and fast UI
♥ Clean, minimal design
