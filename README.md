📝 Notes App <br/>
A clean, minimal note-taking app built to keep thoughts where they belong. <br/>
Built with modern tools, a bit of curiosity, and zero tolerance for outdated dependencies.


⭐ Overview <br/>
This project was created to explore Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS together for the first time — because growth > comfort. <br/>
Notes are fully interactive and draggable, giving you a lightweight desktop-style workspace directly in your browser. <br/>
Best experienced on desktop (where dragging things around just feels right).


🚀 Tech Stack <br/>
♥ Next.js – app structure & routing <br/>
♥ TypeScript – type safety and fewer “why is this undefined” moments <br/>
♥ Tailwind CSS – utility-first styling (first time using it, now slightly addicted) <br/>
♥ @dnd-kit – smooth drag-and-drop functionality <br/>
♥ Local Storage – persistent notes without a backend <br/>
♥ Vercel – deployment

🎯 Features <br/>
♥ Create, edit, and delete notes <br/>
♥ Drag and reposition notes freely <br/>
♥ Persistent storage via browser localStorage <br/>
♥ Responsive and fast UI <br/>
♥ Clean, minimal design
